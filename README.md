# Analysis of Pokemon: Constructing the Perfect Pokemon
By Gautam Ponugubati and Kyle De Mariano

BIS 15L - Professsor Ledford

In this project, we are modifying and analyzing the dataset 'pokemon.csv' to find and determine all the best traits that make each pokemon strong and unique. Using R, we collect various data on the strengths and weaknesses of each pokemon, as well as the advantages each pokemon has, to compile and build the "perfect" pokemon.
